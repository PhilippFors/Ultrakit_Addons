Left Click: Aim at a spot on the ground (or wall, either works) and a projectile will come down at that point after a short delay. Works in levels with and without ceilings.

Right Click: Spawns a literal sun at the spot you are aiming at. Will suck in nearby enemies without fail and eviscerate them.
